# A Collection of lightweight parsers 
A bunch of custom parsers for xml and JSON written by me for my own projects.
I've come to the conclusion that its easier to pack all my parsers 
into a package and upload it to github so that when I find and fix bugs in my parsers,it get easily syncs across all projects using these.

# In addition
This package only has **one** dependency for my datastructures package(`sandboxed_collections`).
The `sandboxed_collections` package has **no** dependencies.
